                <h1 id="Unit-1"><a href="#Unit-1" class="headerlink" title="Unit 1"></a>Unit 1</h1><h2 id="BENE"><a href="#BENE" class="headerlink" title="BENE"></a><code>BENE</code></h2><blockquote>
<p><code>bene</code> is <strong>Latin</strong> for “well”<br>A <code>benefit</code> is a good result or effect.<br>Something <code>beneficial</code> produces good results or effects.<br>The Latin root can be heard in other languages as well: “<code>good</code>“ or “<code>fine</code>“.<br>In Spanish is “<code>bueno</code>“<br>In French it’s “<code>bon</code>“</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="benediction"><a href="#benediction" class="headerlink" title="benediction"></a><code>benediction</code></h3><blockquote>
<p>A <code>prayer</code> (<em><strong>words</strong> that you say to God giving thanks or asking for help</em>) that asks for God’s blessing, especially a prayer that <strong>concludes</strong>(<em>conclude: to come to an end; to bring something to an end</em>) a worship service.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>E.g.</p>
<ul>
<li>The moment the <strong>bishop</strong> (<em>a senior priest in charge of the work of the Church in a city or district</em>) had finished his <code>benediction</code>, she squeezed quickly out of her row and darted out the cathedral’s side entrance.</li>
</ul>
<p>From</p>
<ul>
<li><code>dictio</code> : Latin root for “speaking”.</li>
<li><code>benediction</code> becomes something like “well-wishing”.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="benefactor"><a href="#benefactor" class="headerlink" title="benefactor"></a><code>benefactor</code></h3><blockquote>
<p><code>Someone</code> who helps another person or group, <strong>especially by giving money</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>E.g.</p>
<ul>
<li>An anonymous <strong>benefactor</strong> had given $15 million to establish an ecological institute at the university.</li>
<li>Many <strong>benefactor</strong> reported that giving away their money turned out to be the most rewarded thing they ever did.</li>
</ul>
<p>Usage</p>
<ul>
<li>A <code>benefactor</code> may be involved in almost any field.<ul>
<li>One may endow (<em>endow something: to give a large sum of money to a school, a college or another institution to provide it with an income</em>) a scholarship fund;</li>
<li>Another may give money to expand a library;</li>
<li>Still another may leave a generous sum to hospital in her will.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="beneficiary"><a href="#beneficiary" class="headerlink" title="beneficiary"></a><code>beneficiary</code></h3><blockquote>
<p><code>A person</code> or <code>organization</code> that benefits or is expected to benefit from something, especially one that receives money or property when someone dies.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>E.g.</p>
<ul>
<li>Living in a tailer in near-poverty, she received word in the mail that her father had died, naming her as the sole <strong>beneficiary</strong> of his <strong>life-insurance</strong> (<em>a type of insurance in which you make regular payments so that you receive a sum of money when you are a particular age, or so that your family will receive a sum of money when you die</em>) policy.</li>
</ul>
<p>Usage</p>
<ul>
<li><code>Beneficiary</code> is often used in connection with <strong>life insurance</strong>, but it shows up in <strong>many other contexts</strong> as well.<ul>
<li>A college may be the beneficiary of a private donation.</li>
<li>Your uncle’s will may make a church his sole beneficiary, in which case all his money and property will go to it when he dies.</li>
<li>A “third-part beneficiary” of a contract is a person (often a child) who the people signing the contract (which is usually an insurance policy or an employee-benefit plan) want to benefit from it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>In a more general way, a small business may be a beneficiary of changes to the tax code, or a restaurant may be the beneficiary when the one across the street <strong>closes down</strong> (<em>the act of stopping work, the act of stopping work, especially permanently, in an office, a factory, etc.</em>) and its whole lunch crowd starts coming in.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="benevolence"><a href="#benevolence" class="headerlink" title="benevolence"></a><code>benevolence</code></h3><blockquote>
<p>Kindness, generosity.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>E.g.</p>
<ul>
<li>In those financially <strong>desperate</strong> (<em>extremely serious or dangerous</em>) years, the young couple was saved only by the benevolence of her <strong>elderly</strong> (<em>used as a polite word for old</em>) great-uncle.</li>
</ul>
<p>From</p>
<ul>
<li>Part of <code>benevolence</code> comes from the Latin root meaning “wish”.</li>
</ul>
<p>Usage</p>
<ul>
<li>The novels of Charles Dickens often include a <code>benevolent</code> figure who rescues the main characters at some point.</li>
<li>To be <code>benevolent</code>, it helps to have money, but it’s not necessary; kind assistance of a non-financial sort may turn out to be a lifesaving <code>benevolence</code> as well.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="AM"><a href="#AM" class="headerlink" title="AM"></a><code>AM</code></h2><blockquote>
<p>comes from the Latin <code>amare</code>, “<strong>to love</strong>“.<br>The Roman god of love was know by two different names, <em><strong>Cupid</strong></em> and <em><strong>Amor</strong></em>.<br><code>Amiable</code> means “<strong>friendly or good-natured</strong>“, and <code>amigo</code> is Spanish for “<strong>friend</strong>“.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="amicable"><a href="#amicable" class="headerlink" title="amicable"></a><code>amicable</code></h3><blockquote>
<p>Friendly, peaceful.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>E.g.</p>
<ul>
<li>Their relations with their <strong>in-laws</strong> (<em>your relatives by marriage, especially the parents of your husband or wife</em>) were <strong>generally</strong> (<em>most of the time</em>) amicable, despite some <strong>bickering</strong> (<em>the activity of arguing about things that are not important</em>) during the holidays.</li>
</ul>
<p>Usage</p>
<ul>
<li><code>Amicable</code> often describes <strong>relations between two groups, or especially to nations</strong> (<em>nation: a country considered as a group of people with the same language, culture and history, who live in a particular area under one government</em>).<ul>
<li>The United States and Canada, which are proud of sharing the longest unguarded border in the world. So they often speak of an <strong>amicable meeting</strong> or an <strong>amicable settlement</strong> (<em>settlement: an official agreement that ends an argument between two people or groups</em>).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>When <code>amicable</code> describes <strong>more personal relations</strong>, it may indicate <strong>a rather formal friendliness</strong>. But it’s always nice when two friends who’ve been quarreling manage to have an <strong>amicable conversation</strong> and to say <strong>amicable good-byes</strong> at the end.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="enamored"><a href="#enamored" class="headerlink" title="enamored"></a><code>enamored</code></h3><blockquote>
<p>Charmed or fascinated; inflamed with love.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>E.g.</p>
<ul>
<li>Rebecca quickly became <code>enamored</code> of the town’s <strong>rustic</strong> (<em>typical of the country or of country people; simple</em>) surroundings, its slow pace, and its <strong>eccentric</strong> (<em>considered by other people to be strange or unusual</em>) characters.</li>
</ul>
<p>Usage</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Computer hackers are always <em><strong>enamored of</strong></em> their new programs and games.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Millions of readers have found themselves <em><strong>enamored with</strong></em> Jane Austen’s novels.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Romeo and Juliet were, of course, <strong>utterly</strong> (<em>(used for emphasis) completely</em>) <em><strong>enamored of</strong></em> each other.</p>
</li>
<li><p>But we also often use the word in negative contexts:</p>
<ul>
<li>A friend at work may complain that she’s <strong>not enamored of</strong> the new boss.</li>
<li>When you start talking about how you’re <strong>not enamored with</strong> the neighbors it may be time to move.</li>
<li>(Note that both <code>of</code> and <code>with</code> are <em><strong>commonly used after enamored.</strong></em>)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="amorous"><a href="#amorous" class="headerlink" title="amorous"></a><code>amorous</code></h3><blockquote>
<p>Having or showing strong feelings of attraction or love.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>E.g.</p>
<ul>
<li>It turned out that the <code>amorous</code> Congressman had gotten his girlfriend a good job and was paying for her apartment.</li>
</ul>
<p>Usage</p>
<ul>
<li><p>A couple <strong>smooching</strong> (<em>smooch: to kiss and hold somebody closely, especially when you are dancing slowly</em>) on a park bench could be called <strong>amorous</strong>, or a young married couple who are always hugging and kissing.</p>
</li>
<li><p>But the word is <strong>often used a bit sarcastically</strong>, </p>
<ul>
<li>as when a tabloid newspaper gets hold of some scandalous photos and calls the participants “<strong>the amorous pair</strong>“.</li>
<li>In such cases, we may be encountered to think <strong>the attraction is more physical than emotional</strong>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="paramour"><a href="#paramour" class="headerlink" title="paramour"></a><code>paramour</code></h3><blockquote>
<p>A lover, often secret, not allowed by law or custom.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>E.g.</p>
<ul>
<li>He had been coming to the house for two years before her brothers realized that he was actually the <code>paramour</code> of their shy and <strong>withdrawn</strong> (<em>not wanting to talk to other people; extremely quiet and shy</em>) sister.</li>
</ul>
<p>From</p>
<ul>
<li><code>Paramour</code> came to English from French (<em>a language based on Latin</em>), though the modern French don’t use the word.</li>
<li>Since <code>par</code> <code>amour</code> meant “<strong>through love</strong>“, it implies <strong>a relationship based solely on love</strong>, often <strong>physical love</strong>, rather than on social custom or ceremony.</li>
</ul>
<p>Usage</p>
<ul>
<li>So today it tends to refer to <strong>the lover of a married man or woman</strong>, but may be used for any lover who isn’t <strong>obeying</strong> (<em>obey: to do what you are told or expected to do</em>) the social rules.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="BELL"><a href="#BELL" class="headerlink" title="BELL"></a><code>BELL</code></h2><blockquote>
<p>comes from the <em><strong>Latin</strong></em> word meaning “<strong>war</strong>“.<br><em><strong>Bellona</strong></em> was the little-known Roman goddess of war; her husband, <em><strong>Mars</strong></em>, was the god of war.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="antebellum"><a href="#antebellum" class="headerlink" title="antebellum"></a><code>antebellum</code></h3><blockquote>
<p>Existing before a war, especially before the America Civil War (1861-1865).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>E.g.</p>
<ul>
<li>When World War Ⅰ was over, the French nobility found it impossible to return to their extravagant antebellum way of life.</li>
</ul>
<p>Usage</p>
<ul>
<li>Even countries that win a war often end up worse off than they had been before, and the losers almost always do. So <code>antebellum</code> often <strong>summons up</strong> (<em>summon up: to make a feeling, an idea, a memory, etc. come into your mind</em>) images of ease, elegance, and entertainment that disappeared in the <strong>postwar</strong> (<em>existing, happening or made in the period after a war, especially the Second World War</em>) years.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="bellicose"><a href="#bellicose" class="headerlink" title="bellicose"></a><code>bellicose</code></h3><blockquote>
<p><strong>Warlike</strong> (<em>aggressive and wanting to fight</em>), aggressive, <strong>quarrelsome</strong> (<em>(of a person) often arguing with other people</em>).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>E.g.</p>
<ul>
<li>The <code>bellicose</code> party always got selected whenever there was tension along the border and the public believed that military action would lead to security.</li>
</ul>
<p>Usage</p>
<ul>
<li>Since <code>bellicose</code> describes <strong>an attitude that hopes for actual war</strong>, the word is generally applied to <em><strong>nations</strong></em> and <em><strong>their leaders</strong></em>.<ul>
<li>In the 20th century, it was commonly used to describe such figures as Germany’s Kaiser Wilhelm, Italy’s Benito Mussolini, and Japan’s General Tojo, <em><strong>leaders who believed their countries had everything to gain by starting wars</strong></em>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The international relations of a nation with <strong>bellicose foreign policy</strong> tend to be stormy and difficult, and <strong>bellicosity</strong> usually makes the rest of the world very uneasy.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="belligerence"><a href="#belligerence" class="headerlink" title="belligerence"></a><code>belligerence</code></h3><blockquote>
<p>Aggressiveness, combativeness.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>E.g.</p>
<ul>
<li>The belligerence in Turner’s voice told them that the warning was a serious threat.</li>
</ul>
<p>Usage</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Unlike</strong> <em><strong>bellicose</strong></em> and <em><strong>bellicosity</strong></em>, the world <code>belligerence</code> can be used <strong>at every level from the personal to the global</strong>.<ul>
<li>  The <strong>belligerence</strong> of Marlon Brando’s performances as the violent Stanley Kowalski in A Streetcar Named Desire electrified the country in the 1940s and ‘50s. At the same time, <strong>belligerence speeches</strong> by leaders of the Soviet Union and the United States throughout the Cold War were keeping the world on edge.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><code>Belligerent</code> is even a noun; the terrible war in the Congo in recent years, for example, has involved seven nations as belligerents.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="rebellion"><a href="#rebellion" class="headerlink" title="rebellion"></a><code>rebellion</code></h3><blockquote>
<p>Open <strong>defiance</strong> (<em>the act of openly refusing to obey somebody/something</em>) and <strong>opposition</strong> (<em>the act of strongly disagreeing with somebody/something, especially with the aim of preventing something from happening</em>), <strong>sometimes armed</strong>, <strong>to a person or thing in authority</strong> (<em>the power to give orders to people</em>).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>E.g.</p>
<ul>
<li>A student <strong>rebellion</strong> that afternoon in Room 13 resulted in the new substitute teacher racing out of the building in tears.</li>
</ul>
<p>Usage</p>
<ul>
<li>Plenty of teenagers <code>rebel</code> against their parents in all kinds of ways.</li>
<li>But a <code>rebellion</code> usually <em><strong>involves a group</strong></em>.</li>
<li><code>Armed rebellions</code> are usually <strong>put down</strong> (<em>to stop something by force</em>) by a country’s armed forces, or at least kept from expanding beyond a small area.<ul>
<li>The American War of Independence was first viewed by British as a <strong>minor</strong> (<em>not very large, important or serious</em>) <strong>rebellion</strong> that would soon run its course, but this particular rebellion led a <strong>full-fledged</strong> revolution (<em>full-fledged: completely developed; with all the qualifications necessary for something</em>)(<em>fledged:  able to fly</em>) – that is , the <strong>overthrow</strong> (<em>the act of taking power by force from a leader or government</em>) of a government.</li>
</ul>

<li>Rebellion, armed or otherwise, has often alerted those in power that those they control very unhappy.</li>

<p>E.g.</p>
<ul>
<li>It took the police hours to pacify the angry demonstrators.</li>
</ul>
<p>Usage</p>
<ul>
<li>Someone stirred up be a strong emotion can usually be <code>pacified</code> by some kind words and the <strong>removal</strong> (<em>the act of getting rid of something</em>) of its causes.</li>
<li>Unhappy babies are often given a rubber <code>pacifier</code> for sucking to make them stop crying.</li>
<li>During the Vietnam War, <code>pacification</code> of an area meant using armed force to drive out the enemy, which might be followed by bringing the local people over to our side by building schools and providing social services.</li>
<li>But an army can often bring “<code>peace</code>“ by pure force, without soothing anyone’s emotions.</li>

<p><strong>A person</strong> who opposed to war or violence, especially someone who refuses to <strong>bear arms</strong> (<em>to serve as a soldier</em>) or fight, on moral or religious grounds.</p>

<li>Her grandfather had fought in the <strong>Marines</strong> (<em>the Marine Corps, 海军陆战队</em>) in the World War Ⅱ, but in his later years he had become almost a <code>pacifist</code>, opposing every war <strong>for one reason or another</strong> (<em>因某种理由</em>).</li>
</ul>
<p>Usage</p>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>Quakers</strong> (<em>a member of the Society of Friends, a Christian religious group that meets without any formal ceremony and is strongly opposed to violence and war</em>) and the <strong>Jehovah’s Witnesses</strong> (<em>a member of a religious organization that believes the end of the world will happen soon and sends its members to people’s houses to try to persuade them to join</em>) are <code>pacifist</code> religious groups, and <strong>Henry David Thoreau</strong> (<em>(1817-62) a US writer and poet who believed strongly in the rights of individual people.</em>) and <strong>Martin Luther King</strong> (<em>(1929-68) the most important leader of the US civil rights movement</em>) are probably the most famous American pacifists.</li>

<p>E.g.</p>
<ul>
<li>The girl made a pact never to reveal what had happened on that terrifying night in the abandoned house.</li>
</ul>
<p>Usage</p>
<ul>
<li><code>Pact</code> has “<em><strong>peace</strong></em>“ at its root because a pact <strong>often ends a period of unfriendly relations.</strong></li>
<li>The words is generally used in the field of <strong>international relations</strong>, <ul>
<li>where diplomats may speak of an “<strong>arm pact</strong>“, a “<strong>trade pact</strong>“, or a “<strong>fishing-right pact</strong>“.</li>

<ul>
<li>She had only three husbands, <em><code>pace</code></em> some Hollywood historians who claim she had as many as six.</li>
</ul>
<p>Usage</p>
<ul>
<li>This word looks like another that is much more familiar, but <strong>notice how it’s pronounced</strong>.</li>
<li>It is used only by <strong>intellectuals</strong> (<em>a person who is well educated and enjoys activities in which they have to think seriously about things</em>), and often printed in <em><strong>italics</strong></em> so that the reader doesn’t mistake it for the other word.</li>
<li>Writers use it when correcting an opinion that many people believe; for example, “The costs of the program, <em><strong>pace</strong></em> some commentators, will not be significant.”</li>
<li>So what does pace have to do with peace?<ul>

</ul>
<p>Usage</p>
<ul>
<li><code>Criminology</code> includes <strong>the study of all aspects of crime and law enforcement</strong> – criminal psychology, the social setting of crime, prohibition and prevention, investigation and detection, capture and punishment.</li>
<li>Thus, <strong>many of the people involved</strong> – legislators, social workers, probation officers, judges, etc. – could possibly be considered <code>criminologists</code>, though <strong>the word usually refers only to scholars and researchers</strong>.</li>

<ul>
<li><code>Decriminalization</code> of various “victimless crime” – crime that don’t directly harm others, such as private gambling and drug-taking – has been recommended by <strong>conservatives</strong> (<em>connected with the British Conservative Party</em>) as well as <strong>liberals</strong> (<em>connected with the British Liberal Party in the past, or a Liberal Party in another country</em>), who often claim that it would be ease the burden on the legal system, decrease the amount of money flowing to criminals, and increase personal liberty.</li>
<li><code>Decriminalization</code> is not the same as legalization; decriminalization may still <strong>call for a small fine</strong> (<em>like a traffic ticket</em>) (<em>call for: to need something</em>), and may apply only to use or possession of something, leaving the actual sale of goods or services illegal.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="incriminate"><a href="#incriminate" class="headerlink" title="incriminate"></a><code>incriminate</code></h3><blockquote>

<p>E.g.</p>
<ul>
<li>The muddy <strong>tracks</strong> (<em>track: marks left by a person, an animal or a moving vehicle</em>) leading to and from the cookie jar were enough to <code>incriminate</code> them.</li>
</ul>
<p>Usage</p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>Testimony</strong></em> may <code>incriminate</code> a suspect by placing him the scene of a crime, and <code>incriminating</code> evidence is the kind that strongly links him to it.</li>
<li>But the word doesn’t always refer to an actual crime. <ul>

<ul>
<li>Defending oneself from a verbal attack <strong>by means of</strong> (<em>through the use of</em>) a <strong>counter-attack</strong> (<em>an attack made in response to the attack of an enemy or opponent in war, sport or an argument</em>) is as natural as physical self-defense.<ul>
<li>So a disaster often brings <code>recriminations</code> among those connected with it, and divorces and child-<strong>custody</strong> (<em>the legal right or duty to take care of or keep somebody/something; the act of taking care of something/somebody</em>) battles usually involve recriminations between husband and wife.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>An actual crime isn’t generally involved, but it may be</strong>; when two suspects start exchanging angry <code>recriminations</code> after they’ve been picked up, it often leads to one of them turning against the other in court.</li>

</ul>
<p>Usage</p>
<ul>
<li><code>Approbation</code> is a noun form of <code>approve</code>, but approbation is usually stronger than mere <code>approval</code> (<em>the feeling that somebody/something is good or acceptable; a positive opinion of somebody/something</em>).</li>
<li><strong>An official commendation for bravery</strong> is an example of approbation; getting reelected to office by a wide margin indicates <code>public approbation</code>; and the <code>social approbation</code> received by a star <strong>quarterback</strong> (<em>the player who directs the team’s attacking play and passes the ball to other players at the start of each attack</em>) in high school usually makes all the pain worthwhile.</li>

<p>Usage</p>
<ul>
<li>Ever since people have written wills, those wills have had to be proven <strong>genuine</strong> (<em>real; exactly what it appears to be; not artificial</em>) by a judge.</li>
<li>Without a <code>probate</code> process, greedy acquaintances or relatives could <strong>write up</strong> (<em>to record something in writing in a full and complete form, often using notes that you made earlier</em>) a fake will stating that all the person’s wealth belonged  to them.</li>
<li>To establish a will as genuine, it must be witnessed and <strong>stamped</strong> (<em>to print letters, words, a design, etc. onto something using a special tool</em>) by someone officially licensed to do so (<em>though wills have sometimes been approved even when they were just written on a piece of scrap paper, with no witnesses</em>).</li>
<li>Today we use <code>probate</code> <strong>more broadly</strong> to mean <strong>everything that’s handled</strong> in <code>probate court</code>, special court that <strong>oversees</strong> (<em>to watch somebody/something and make sure that a job or an activity is done correctly</em>) the handling of <strong>estates</strong> (<em>estate: the money and property left when someone dies</em>), making sure that everyone eventually receives what is properly theirs.</li>

<ul>
<li><code>Probity</code> is a quality the public generally hopes for in its elected <strong>officials</strong> (<em>(often in compounds) a person who is in a position of authority in a large organization</em>) but doesn’t always get.<ul>

<p>Usage</p>
<ul>
<li>The related verb of <code>reprobate</code> is <code>reprove</code>, which originally, as the <strong>opposite of</strong> <code>approve</code>, meant “<strong>to condemn</strong>“. </li>
<li>Thus, a <code>reprobate</code>, as the word was <strong>used in Biblical translations</strong>, was <strong>someone condemned to hell</strong>.</li>
<li>But for many years <code>reprobate</code> has been said in a tone of <strong>joshing</strong> (<em>josh: to gently make fun of somebody or talk to them in a joking way</em>) <strong>affection</strong> (<em>a feeling of liking or love and <strong>caring</strong> (kind, helpful and showing that you care about other people)</em>), usually to <strong>describe someone of doubtful morals but good humor</strong>.<ul>

<ul>
<li>We realized that the situation was <code>grave</code> and the slightest incident could spark <strong>all-out</strong> (<em>in a very determined way using every possible effort</em>) war.</li>
</ul>
<p>Usage</p>
<ul>
<li><code>Gravity</code> has a familiar physical meaning but also a nonphysical meaning – basically “seriousness”. Thus, something <code>grave</code> possesses <code>gravity</code>.</li>
<li>You can refer to <strong>the gravity of a person’s manner</strong>, though public figures today seem to have a lot less gravity than they used to have.</li>
<li>Or you can talk about a <strong>grave situation</strong>, as in the example sentence.</li>
<li>But even though Shakespeare makes a <strong>pun</strong> (<em>the clever or humorous use of a word that has more than one meaning, or of words that have different meanings but sound the same</em>) on <code>grave</code> when a dying character talks about being buried the next day (“Ask for me tomorrow and you shall find me a grave man”), the word meaning “hole for burying a body” isn’t actually related.</li>

<ul>
<li>The head of the committee never failed to carry herself with the <code>gravitas</code> she felt was appropriate to her office.</li>
</ul>
<p>Usage</p>
<ul>
<li>This word comes to us straight from <em><strong>Latin</strong></em>.</li>
<li>Among the <strong>Romans</strong> (<em>a book of the Bible</em>), <code>gravitas</code> was thought to be essential to the character and functions of any adult (male) in authority. Even the head of a <strong>household</strong> (<em>all the people living together in a house or flat (a set of rooms for living in, usually on one floor of a building)</em>) or a low-level official would strive for this important quality.</li>

<p>E.g.</p>

<ul>
<li>To <code>gravitate</code> is <strong>to respond</strong>, almost <strong>unconsciously</strong>, to <strong>a force that works like</strong> <code>gravity</code> to draw things steadily to it as if by their own weight.<ul>

<ul>
<li>She went back to the soccer team before the knee was completely healed, which naturally aggravated the injury.</li>
</ul>
<p>Usage</p>
<ul>
<li>Since the <code>grav-</code> root means basically “<strong>weighty</strong> or <strong>serious</strong>“ the original meaning of <code>aggravate</code> was “<strong>to make more serious</strong>“.<ul>
<li>A bad relationship with your parents can <code>be aggravated by </code>marrying someone who nobody likes, for example.</li>

<ul>
<li>Even though <code>kleptomania</code> is often <strong>the butt of</strong> (<em>to be the person or thing that other people often make jokes about</em>) jokes, its actually a serious mental illness, often associated with mood disorders, anxiety disorders, eating disorders, and <strong>substance abuse</strong> (<em>the habit of taking too much of a harmful drug or drinking too much alcohol</em>).</li>

<p>Usage</p>
<ul>
<li>Some experts distinguish between an <em><strong>alcoholic</strong></em> and a <code>dipsomaniac</code>, reserving <code>dipsomaniac</code> for some involved  in frequent <strong>episode</strong> (<em>a period of time during which somebody is affected by a particular illness or a particular stage of a longer illness</em>) of <strong>binge</strong> (<em>a short period of time when somebody does too much of a particular activity, especially eating or drinking alcohol</em>) drinking and <strong>blackouts</strong> (<em>blackout: to become unconscious for a short time</em>).</li>

<li>When the governor started calling for arming his Nation Guard with nuclear weapons, the voter finally realized they had elected a <code>megalomaniac</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>From</p>
<ul>
<li>Since the Greek root <code>megalo</code> means “large”, someone who is <code>megalomaniacal</code> has mental disorder marked by feelings of personal <strong>grandeur</strong> (<em>the importance or social status somebody has or thinks they have</em>).</li>
</ul>
<p>Usage</p>
<ul>
<li><code>Megalomania</code> has probably <strong>afflicted</strong> (<em>afflict: to affect somebody/something in an unpleasant or harmful way</em>) many rulers throughout history:<ul>
<li>The Roman emperor <strong>Caligula</strong> (<em>(12–41 AD) a Roman emperor who was known for being extremely violent, cruel, and mad</em>) insisted that he be worshipped as a living god.</li>
<li>Joseph Stalin suffered from the <strong>paranoia</strong>(<em>a mental illness in which a person wrongly believes that other people are trying to harm them, that they are somebody very important, etc.</em>) that often accompanies <code>megalomania</code>, and had thousands of his countrymen executed as a result.</li>

<p>E.g.</p>

<li>He’s a completely unimpressive person, but that doesn’t keep him from being an egomaniac.</li>

<p>From</p>
<ul>
<li><code>Ego</code> is Latin for “I”, and in English <code>ego</code> usually means “sense of self-worth”.</li>
</ul>
<p>Usage</p>
<ul>
<li>Most people’s egos stay at a healthy level, but some become exaggerated.  <code>Egomaniacs</code> may display a grandiose sense of self-importance, with fantasies about their own brilliance or beauty, intense envy of others, a lack of sympathy, and a need to be adored or feared.</li>
<li>But, like <em><strong>megalomaniac</strong></em>, the word <code>egomaniac</code> is thrown around by lots of people who don’t mean much more by it than <em><strong>blowhard</strong></em>(<em>a person who talks too proudly about something they own or something they have done</em>) or <em><strong>know-it-all</strong></em>(<em>a person who behaves as if they know everything</em>).</li>

<p>E.g.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Analysts</strong> (<em>analyst: (also psychoanalyst)a person who treats patients using psychoanalysis</em>) are constantly trying to understand the nation’s <code>psyche</code> and why the U.S. often behaves so differently from other countries.</li>
</ul>
<p>From</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sometime</strong> (<em>at a time that you do not know exactly or has not yet been decided</em>) back in the 16th century, we borrowed the word <code>psyche</code> directly from Greek into English.</li>
<li>In Greek mythology, <code>Psyche</code> was a beautiful princess who fell in love with Eros(<em>in Greek mythology, the god of sexual and romantic love. In Roman mythology his name is Cupid.</em>), god of love, and went through terrible trials before being allowed to marry him. The story is often understood to be about the soul redeeming itself through love.</li>
<li>To the Greeks, <code>psyche</code> is also meant “butterfly”, which suggests how they imagined the soul.</li>
</ul>
<p>Usage</p>
<ul>
<li>In English, <code>psyche</code> often sound less spiritual than <em><strong>soul</strong></em>, less intellectual than <em><strong>mind</strong></em>, and more private that <em><strong>personality</strong></em>.</li>

<p>E.g.</p>
<ul>
<li>In her only <code>psychedelic</code> experience, back in 1970, she had watched with horror as walls began crawling with bizarrely colored creatures.</li>
</ul>
<p>Usage</p>
<ul>
<li>The most famous – or notorious – of the <code>psychedelic</code> drugs is <em><strong>LSD</strong></em>, a comound that can be obtained from various mushrooms and other fungi but is usually created in the lab.</li>
<li>The other well-known <code>psychedelics</code> are <em><strong>psilocybin</strong></em> (likewise obtained from fungi) and <em><strong>mescaline</strong></em> (obtained from <strong>peyote cactus</strong> (<em>peyote: a small, blue-green cactus that contains a powerful drug that affects people’s minds</em>)(<em>cactus: a plant that grows in hot dry regions, especially one with thick stems covered in spines but without leaves.

<li>How <code>psychedelics</code> produce their effects is still <strong>fairly</strong> (<em>to some extent but not very</em>) mysterious, partly because research ceased for almost 20 years because of their reputation. but scientists are determined to find the answers and much research is now under way.</li>

</ul>
<p>From</p>
<ul>
<li>Since the Greek word <code>soma</code> means “body”, <code>psychosomatic</code> suggests the link between mind and body.</li>
</ul>
<p>Usage</p>
<ul>
<li>Since one’s mental state may have an important effect on one’s physical state, research on new medicines always involves giving some patients in the experiment a <strong>placebo</strong> (<em>fake medicine</em>), and some who receive the sugar pills will seem to improve.</li>
<li>You may hear someone say of someone else’s symptoms, “Oh, it’s probably just <code>psychosomatic</code>“, implying that the physical pain or illness is imaginary – may be just an attempt to get sympathy – and the person could will it away if he or she wanted to.

<p>Usage</p>
<ul>
<li>Many psychologists offer pyschological <strong>counseling</strong> (<em>counsel: advice, especially given by older people or experts; a piece of advice</em>), and psychological counseling can usually be called <code>psychotherapy</code>, so many psychologists can be called <code>psychotherapists</code>.</li>
<li>The most intense form of <code>psychotherapy</code>, called <code>pychoanalysis</code>, usually requires several visits a week. A <strong>competing</strong> (<em>unable to exist or be true at the same time</em>) type of therapy known as <em><strong>behavior therapy</strong></em> focuses on changing a person’s behavior (often some individual habit such as <strong>stuttering</strong> (<em>stutter: a speech problem in which a person finds it difficult to say the first sound of a word and repeats it several times</em>), <strong>tics</strong> (<em>tic: a sudden, quick movement of a muscle, especially in your face or head, that you cannot control</em>), or <strong>phobias</strong> (<em>phobia: a strong unreasonable fear of something</em>)) without looking very deeply into hist or her mental state.</li>

<p>Usage</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Arms</strong> (<em>arms: weapons, especially as used by the army, navy, etc.</em>) <strong>shipments</strong> (<em>shipment: the process of sending goods from one place to another</em>) coming to a country are sometimes <code>intercept</code>, but such <code>intercepts</code> can sometimes be understood as acts of war.</li>

<ul>
<li><code>Projection</code> has various meanings, but what they all have in common is that <em><strong>something is sent out or forward.</strong></em><ul>

<ul>
<li>A <code>tractor</code> is something that pulls something else.

<ul>
<li>The prefix <code>sub-</code> normally means “below,” and the <code>sub</code> in <code>subsequent</code> seems to imply that everything after first is <strong>somehow</strong>(<em>somehow: for a reason that you do not know or understand</em>) inferior.</li>

</ul>
<p>From</p>
<ul>
<li>The root <code>glyk-</code> means “sweet” in Greek, so <code>glyc</code> shows up in the names of various terms referring to a sugar as a chemical ingredient, such as <em><strong>glycerine</strong></em>(<em>glycerine: 甘油；an alternative name for glycerol, frequently used in labels showing ingredients</em>) and <em><strong>monoglyceride</strong></em>(<em>monoglyceride: any of various esters of glycerol in which only one of the three hydroxyl groups is esterified and which are often used as emulsifiers</em>)(<em>ester: a chemical that is formed by the reaction between an acid and an alcohol.

<ul>
<li>People with <strong>diabetes</strong>(<em>diabetes: a medical condition in which the body cannot produce enough insulin to control the amount of sugar in the blood</em>) have difficulty controlling the sugar in their blood.

<li>A sea <strong>invertebrate</strong>(<em>invertebrate: any animal with no backbone, for example a worm</em>) that has a mouth opening at one end surrounded by stinging <strong>tentacles</strong>(<em>tentacle: a long, thin part of the body of some creatures, such as squid, used for feeling or holding things, for moving or for getting food</em>).</li>
<li>A growth projecting from a <strong>mucous membrane</strong>(<em>mucous membrane: a thin layer of skin that covers the inside of the nose and mouth and the outside of other organs in the body, producing mucus to prevent these parts from becoming dry</em>), as on the colon or <strong>vocal cords</strong>(<em>vocal cords: the thin pieces of tissue in the throat that are moved by the flow of air to produce the voice</em>).</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>E.g.</p>
<ul>
<li>She had had a polyp removed from her throat, and for two weeks afterward she could only whisper.</li>
</ul>
<p>From</p>
<ul>
<li>This term comes from <em><code>polypous</code></em>, a Greek word for “octopus,” which meant literally “many-footed.”</li>
</ul>
<p>Usage</p>
<ul>
<li>To the untrained eye, the invertebrate known as the <code>polyp</code> may likewise appear to be many-footed, though it never walks anywhere since its “feet” are tentacles, used for stinging tiny organisms which the <code>polyp</code> then <strong>devours</strong>(<em>devour something: to eat all of something quickly, especially because you are very hungry</em>).</li>
<li>The type of tumor known as <code>polyps</code> are got their name because some seem to be attached to the surface by branching “foot”–like roots, even though most do not. <code>Polyps</code> of the nose or vocal cords are usually only inconvenient, causing breathing difficulty or <strong>hoarseness</strong>(<em>hoarseness: the quality in somebody’s voice of sounding rough and unpleasant, especially because of a sore throat (= a painful throat because of an infection)</em>), and can be removed easily; however, <code>polyps</code> in the intestines can sometimes <strong>turn</strong>(<em>turn: to change into a particular state or condition; to make something do this</em>) <strong>cancerous</strong>(<em>cancerous: affected or caused by cancer</em>).</li>
</ul>
